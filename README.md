<h1>Hello, welcome to my Github repository!</h1>
<p>I'm Jesus 😊, make yourself comfortable and take a look at whatever you want. You'll find small projects in .NET that I use to learn and grow. I work with .NET Core, REST API, Entity Framework Core, and Angular, among other technologies 🔥💻</p>
<p>My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge and skills cache. That's why I'm here! I'm always eager to learn new technologies and take on new challenges. 🎉😊</p>
<p>Thanks for visiting my corner on GitHub. If you have any questions, suggestions, or just want to chat, feel free to contact me.🚀👋</p>
